Notes
-------------
    
    Package == Project == Workspace

    Types of Package
    --------------------

        Executable
            Generates a file that we can run
            (when we use package main)
            it should always have a function called main

        Reusable
            Code used as ´helpers´. Good place to put reusable logic  
            (any other name that is not main)


import 
-------------

    import "fmt"
        short of format, it is used for printing
